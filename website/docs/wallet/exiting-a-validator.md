Voluntarily exiting your validator from the Ethereum network is a one time command using the [prysmctl tool](../prysm-usage/prysmctl.md). Note that this operation was previously facilitated by a command exposed by the Prysm validator client, and can still be accessed that way. At a high level, you'll follow these steps to exit your validator:

 1. Ensure that you have access to a fully synced beacon node.
 2. Issue the `validator exit` command to your validator and allow the beacon node to access to your validator keys through the `--wallet-dir` flag or [web3signer](web3signer.md) and the `--beacon-rpc-provider` flag (examples provided below).
 3. Select the account(s) that should be exited. This step can be skipped by specifying the account(s) via the `--public-keys` flag when issuing the `validator exit` command.
 4. Confirm your understanding of the consequences of exiting your validator by typing `Exit my validator` when prompted.

After providing confirmation, voluntary exit request will be broadcasted through your beacon node. Visit our [Command-line options documentation](../prysm-usage/parameters.md) for more configuration options.

:::caution 

Voluntarily exiting will not withdraw fund, validators must have their `withdrawal_credentials` updated in addition to exiting to withdraw the entire balance. Learn more on how to withdraw earnings or fully withdraw your validator in [our guide](withdraw-validator.md)

The `validator-exit command` only supports gRPC, which means that the specified `beacon-rpc-provider` needs to be a Prysm beacon node (because Prysm's beacon node client is the only client that supports gRPC)

:::

Examples below use the local prysm wallet, if you are using [web3signer](web3signer.md), replace the `wallet-dir` flag with the flags used to run the validator with web3signer.
