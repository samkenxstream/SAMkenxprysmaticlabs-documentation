**Checkpoint sync** is a feature that significantly speeds up the initial sync between your beacon node and the Beacon Chain. With checkpoint sync configured, your beacon node will begin syncing from a recently finalized checkpoint instead of syncing from genesis. This can make installations, validator migrations, recoveries, and testnet deployments *way* faster.

To sync from a checkpoint, your Prysm beacon node needs three pieces of information: the latest finalized `BeaconState`, the `SignedBeaconBlock`, and (if you're on a testnet) the genesis state for the network you're using. Together, the `BeaconState` and `SignedBeaconBlock` represent a single **checkpoint state**.

These three pieces of information can be retrieved either via a **network request**, or via **file export/import**. Syncing via network is the method we recommend to most users because it's more straightforward. 

After configuring checkpoint sync, we strongly recommend [verifying the authenticity of your beacon node's checkpoint](#verify-the-authenticity-of-your-beacon-nodes-checkpoint) as a way to "trust but verify" the integrity of your checkpoint data.

## Option 1: Configure checkpoint sync via network request

Start your Prysm beacon node with the `--checkpoint-sync-url` flag set to a fully synced beacon node's RPC gateway provider endpoint. This endpoint is usually exposed via port `3500`. Set the `--genesis-beacon-api-url` flag to the same URL if you want to fetch the genesis state along with the `BeaconState` and `SignedBeaconBlock`. You may also use a public beacon chain checkpoint sync endpoint at your own risk at https://eth-clients.github.io/checkpoint-sync-endpoints/ .

The following command starts a beacon node with checkpoint sync configured to pull checkpoint state from another local beacon node's RPC endpoint using port `3500`:

<Tabs groupId="os" defaultValue="others" values={[
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'win'},
    {label: 'Linux, MacOS, Arm64', value: 'others'}
]}>
  <TabItem value="win">

```
./prysm.bat beacon-chain --checkpoint-sync-url=http://localhost:3500 --genesis-beacon-api-url=http://localhost:3500
```
    
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="others">

```bash
./prysm.sh beacon-chain --checkpoint-sync-url=http://localhost:3500 --genesis-beacon-api-url=http://localhost:3500
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

To confirm that checkpoint sync has succeeded, look for the following output:

```
level=info msg="requesting <your configured checkpoint sync endpoint>"
```

### Serve checkpoint sync requests

The above instructions tell you how to **request** checkpoint state from another node. If you want to **serve** these requests, run a fully synced node with the following flags:

 - `--enable-debug-rpc-endpoints`: The [Beacon Node API for retrieving a BeaconState](https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs/#/Debug/getStateV2) is a debug endpoint - this flag tells Prysm to enable the endpoint so checkpoint sync requests can be served through your beacon node's RPC gateway provider endpoint.

Note that **this is entirely optional**. The beacon node *requesting* the checkpoint state from this node doesn't need these flags.


## Option 2 (Advanced): Configure checkpoint sync via file export/import

:::info

`Go` needs to be installed on the machine that hosts your synced beacon node if you use this method. See [go.dev](https://go.dev/) for installation instructions.

:::

When you sync via **network request**, the `BeaconState`, `SignedBeaconBlock`, and genesis state files are delivered from one beacon node to another using a peer-to-peer connection. When you sync via **file export/import**, you manually export these files from one beacon node and import them into another. This can be useful if you don't want your beacon node to expose an RPC gateway provider endpoint. Block explorers and client teams can also host these exported files statically as a trusted checkpoint sync source.

Issue the following commands to export the `BeaconState` and `SignedBeaconBlock` files from a synced beacon node using `prysmctl`. Until `prysmctl` is included in Prysm's binary release package, it is necessary to run it from a local source checkout:

:::info

Installing `prysmctl` via `prysm.sh`, or downloading it from prysm's github release page, will be possible in an upcoming stable release.

:::

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:prysmaticlabs/prysm.git

$ go run github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/v3/cmd/prysmctl checkpoint-sync download --beacon-node-host=http://localhost:3500
```

You should see the following output if your export was successful:

```bash

```

The two exported `*.ssz` files are your `BeaconState` and `SignedBeaconBlock` files. Their filenames combine their file type (`state`, `block`), the network (`goerli`), the fork name (`bellatrix`), the slot (`2397120`) and the state or block root in hex encoding. The `checkpoint save` command doesn't export the required genesis state, but the genesis state can be downloaded via `curl` or `wget` using the following command:

```
curl -H "Accept: application/octet-stream"  http://localhost:3500/eth/v1/debug/beacon/states/genesis > genesis.ssz
```

You can also just manually download the genesis state from GitHub: [Goerli-Prater](https://github.com/eth-clients/eth2-networks/raw/master/shared/prater/genesis.ssz) | [Sepolia](https://github.com/eth-clients/merge-testnets/blob/main/sepolia/genesis.ssz)

Use the following command to start your beacon node with checkpoint sync configured to use this checkpoint state:

## Verify the authenticity of your beacon node's checkpoint

To verify that the checkpoint state you're using is legitimate, follow these steps after starting your beacon node with checkpoint sync enabled:

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3500/eth/v1/beacon/headers/finalized` using your browser.
2. Find the `slot` number and `state_root` value.
3. Use a trusted blockchain explorer to verify the `state_root`. To be extra safe, follow this procedure using multiple blockchain explorers. Using `beaconcha.in` as an example, navigate to one of the following pages, replacing `SLOT` with the `slot` you pulled from your browser:
   - **Prater**: https://prater.beaconcha.in/slot/SLOT
   - **Mainnet**: https://beaconcha.in/slot/SLOT
4. Ensure that the `state_root` reported by the blockchain explorer matches the `state_root` you pulled from your browser. If you don't see a match, feel free to reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/prysmaticlabs) and we'll help you troubleshoot.

Note that there are many blockchain explorers - we recommend doing your own research to identify the latest, most trustworthy services. We've used `beaconcha.in` only as an example, not as a recommendation.

## Frequently asked questions

**Is checkpoint sync less secure than syncing from genesis?** <br/>
No. It's actually considered *more* secure thanks to the protections against long-range attacks afforded by [Weak Subjectivity](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/25/proof-stake-learned-love-weak-subjectivity/).

<!--
**How and when are "finalized checkpoints" created?** <br/>
TODO
-->

**Does Prysm's implementation of checkpoint sync support backfilling?**
Prysm's current implementation syncs forward-only. Backfilling will be supported in a future Prysm release. Note that backfilling isn't required to run a validator - it's only required if you want to run an archive node, support other peers, or query chain history through your beacon node.

**Can I use checkpoint sync on any network?** <br/>
Yes. Checkpoint sync is a network-agnostic feature. You can even use it on local devnets.

**Can I use checkpoint sync with an existing, partially synced database?** <br/>
No - checkpoint sync requires a fresh, unused data directory.

**Are there any publicly available, trustworthy checkpoint sync endpoints that I can use?** <br/>
A community maintained list of public Beacon Chain checkpoint sync endpoints is maintained: https://eth-clients.github.io/checkpoint-sync-endpoints/

Feel free to ask on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/prysmaticlabs) if you need help identifying a **Mainnet** checkpoint state provider.

**Do I need to provide a genesis state when using checkpoint sync on Mainnet?** <br/>
No. Mainnet's genesis state is embedded within Prysm.

**Can I use Infura as a checkpoint state provider?** <br/>
Yes. Note that you can't use Infura as an execution node endpoint provider (as was the case pre-Merge), but you can use it as a checkpoint state provider.

**I started a beacon node with checkpoint sync enabled. Can I have other nodes pull checkpoint state from this node right away, or do I need to wait for it to become fully synced?** <br/>
Block and state are immediately finalized upon import, so your first node should be able to serve checkpoint sync requests to other clients without having to wait.

**Does my execution client need to be fully synced before my beacon node can use checkpoint sync?** <br/>
Similar to what happens when you sync from genesis, if your execution client isn't fully synced, your beacon node will go into optimistic sync mode. You'll be able to follow the chain, but any validators connected to your beacon node won't be able to propose.

**How does checkpoint sync relate to weak subjectivity checkpoints?**
Prysm offers a `--weak-subjectivity-checkpoint` flag that allows you to specify a weak subjectivity checkpoint. With this flag specified, your beacon node will ensure that it reconstructs a historical chain that matches the checkpoint root at the given epoch. This can offer the same level of weak subjectivity protection that checkpoint sync offers. See [Weak Subjectivity](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/25/proof-stake-learned-love-weak-subjectivity/) to learn more.
