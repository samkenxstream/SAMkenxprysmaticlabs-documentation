## Introduction

Prysm is an implementation of the [Ethereum proof-of-stake consensus specification](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs). In this quickstart, youâ€™ll use Prysm to run an Ethereum node and optionally a validator. This will let you stake 32 ETH using hardware that you manage.

This is a beginner-friendly guide. Familiarity with the command line is expected, but otherwise this guide makes no assumptions about your technical skills or prior knowledge.

At a high level, we'll walk through the following flow:

 1. Configure an **execution node** using an execution-layer client.
 2. Configure a **beacon node** using Prysm, a consensus-layer client.
 3. Configure a **validator** and stake ETH using Prysm (optional).
